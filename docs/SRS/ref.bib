 abstract = {A new algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform is described. The algorithm is based on a recent result in complexity theory which enables us to derive efficient algorithms for convolution. These algorithms are then used to obtain the new Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.},
